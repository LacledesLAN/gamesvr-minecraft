# Minecraft Dedicated Server in Docker (Java Edition)

Minecraft is a sandbox that allows players to build with a variety of different blocks in a 3D procedurally generated world, requiring creativity from players. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat. Multiple gameplay modes are available, including a survival mode in which the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly, an adventure mode where players can play custom maps created by other players with certain restrictions, a spectator mode where players can freely move throughout a world without being allowed to destroy or build anything and be affected by gravity and collisions, and a hardcore mode, where the player is given only one chance and the game difficulty is locked on hard (if they die, the world is deleted). The PC (Java) version of the game allows players to create mods with new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

## Getting Started with Game Servers in Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is an open-source project that bundles applications into lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers. For a crash course on running Dockerized game servers check out [Using Docker for Game Servers](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/blob/master/GameServers/DockerAndGameServers.md). For tips, tricks, and recommended tools for working with Laclede's LAN Dockerized game server repos see the guide for [Working with our Game Server Repos](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/blob/master/GameServers/WorkingWithOurRepos.md). You can also browse all of our other Dockerized game servers: [Laclede's LAN Game Servers Directory](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/tree/master/GameServers).
